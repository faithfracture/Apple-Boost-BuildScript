* Updated default Boost version to 1.63.0
* Changed min iOS version to 10.0
* Changed min tvOS version to 10.0
* Added a parameter to specify the number of threads to use
* Changed all 'OSX' variable names to 'macOS'
* Changed the name of the log when building for iOS from "iphone-build.log" to
  "ios-build.log"
* Fixed a couple of badly placed braces in the parameter parsing function.
  This should have caused the script to crash when those parameters were used.
  I dunno how or if that ever worked.
* Added more documentation for the --boost-libs parameter. For some reason I
  actually bothered to take the time to build each one of these individually
  and figure out what builds for what. Still a couple things I'm not sure
  about, but... whatever, it's close enough for now. If you want / need more,
  ask.

* Added tvOS support
* Moved build output to a build directory. All output will now be located at:
	{pwd}/build/boost/{boost_version}/{build_target}/
* Only the currently building target will be cleaned (meaning if you are
  building for ios, the osx and tvos output & build directories won't be
  removed).
* Quoted all the path strings (you know, in case you like putting spaces in
  your paths). (Thanks to JanX2 for this)
* Build output is redirected to a log file, rather than stdout / stderr. This
  log file will be located in the target build output directory.
* No longer backup / restore user-config.jam. (No need, since it's being
  written each time the script is run for each target anyways).

-- 2015-09-22 UPDATE --
Added command line args!
You can now specify if you want to build just for iOS or OS X, along with some
other things.
Run boost.sh -h for more info.
Let me know if there are any other parameters that you think would be useful.

-- 2015-09-18 UPDATE --
Fixed script for iOS Simulator (Thanks @XMitja!)
• There is now a MIN_IOS_VERSION variable. Make sure you set this
appropriately.

cleanup function now actually removes all build artifacts

Fixed updateBoost function to move the existing user-config.jam instead 
of copying it. Copying it resulted in writing duplicate entries each time 
the script was run.

NOTE: Currently does not build with bitcode. I will figure that one out when I
get time. 
I'm at the cusp of a product release though, so it might be a little while. 
Just disable bitcode for your project for the time being.

-- 2015-08-26 UPDATE --
The resulting libraries from this script are currently not working for
the iOS simulator under Xcode 7 as of beta 6. I have an issue opened
with Apple about this. It does still work for physical devices though.
As soon as I figure out what the problem is, I will post an update.

-- 2014-12-29 UPDATE --

Updated to work with Boost 1.56, 1.57, and 1.58

Automatically choose the currently selected SDK for both iOS and OSX

Fixed a couple places where the wrong $XXX_DEV_CMD was being used

-- END UPDATE --

This is a modified version of Pete Goodliffe's original boost.sh build script,
(and a couple of other sources whom I can't remember)

The original version didn't work with the 64-bit iPhone Simulator,
and didn't build at all for OSX.

This works for Boost 1.56 and 1.57. If you need the version that builds 1.55
and older, use this gist:
	https://gist.github.com/faithfracture/c629ae4c7168216a9856/61be257e1c0839c85743777d0687becad9913bf7

I also ran into an issue where utf8_codecvt_facet.o existed in both the 
program_options and filesystem libraries. When linking against the
framework, there was a missing vtable entry for it. Adding the step
in unpackArchive() that prepends the library name to the .o files
prevents this error.

I hope this keeps at least one other person from ripping their hair out.

Let me know if you find errors or have optimizations.

I will be updating this as often as necessary.
